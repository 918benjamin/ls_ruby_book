Exception handling is deals with errors before they occur. Rather than
allow the program to crash, exception handling keeps it going and raises
an exception so we can find out how to fix the error. It solves the problem
of unexpected inputs either from somewhere else in the program or from human
users who input something the program can't process correctly.
